Title: Anime Clash: Simple RPG
1. Core Idea (The whole point)

A simple anime-inspired RPG where players:

Spawn in one main area

Fight enemies

Level up

Get stronger weapons or powers

Repeat until ego is satisfied

No deep lore. No galaxy brain systems. Just progression that feels good.

2. Target Platform

Roblox (PC + Mobile)

Casual players, ages 8–16

“Hop in, grind a bit, leave” energy

3. Core Gameplay Loop (This matters most)

Spawn in town

Accept quest OR walk into enemy zone

Kill enemies

Gain EXP + Coins

Level up / Buy better weapon

Unlock next area

Repeat

If this loop isn’t fun, the game is cooked.

4. Combat System (Keep it brain-dead simple)

Basic attack (M1)

1 Skill (cooldown-based)

Enemies auto-target players

Damage = Weapon Damage + Level Bonus

No combos. No parry system. You’re not FromSoftware.

5. Stats (Minimal, no math degree required)

Player Stats:

Level

HP

Damage

That’s it.
No crit chance. No agility. No mana unless you hate yourself.

6. Enemies

Enemy Types:

Weak Mob (easy farm)

Strong Mob (more HP, more damage)

Mini-Boss (area gatekeeper)

Enemy Scaling:

Higher zones = higher stats

Same AI, just stronger numbers

Reuse systems. Be lazy on purpose.

7. World Design

Map Structure:

Safe Spawn Town

Zone 1: Grass Field (starter enemies)

Zone 2: Forest / Ruins

Zone 3: Lava / Dark Area (later update)

Zones unlock by:

Level requirement OR

Killing the area boss

8. Weapons (Anime flavor without chaos)

Weapon Types:

Sword

Katana

Energy Blade

Each weapon only changes:

Damage

Visual effects

No durability. That mechanic belongs in the trash.

9. Progression

EXP from enemies

Level up increases HP + Damage

Coins used to:

Buy weapons

Upgrade weapon damage (optional)

Simple numbers going up = dopamine.

10. UI (Do not overdo it)

Must have:

HP bar

EXP bar

Level text

Coins

Optional:

Quest tracker

Skill cooldown indicator

If the UI looks like a spaceship dashboard, you messed up.

11. Data Saving

Save:

Level

Coins

Equipped weapon

Use ProfileStore or equivalent.
If data fails to load → kick player.
Harsh but fair.

12. Monetization (Optional, don’t be evil)

Gamepass: +10% EXP

Gamepass: Cool weapon skin (cosmetic only)

No pay-to-win. That’s how games die early.

13. MVP Scope (What you build FIRST)

For Version 1:

1 map

3 enemy types

1 weapon shop

Level system

Basic saving

Anything beyond this is “future you” problem.

14. Inspiration (Quietly steal)

Anime Fighters (but slower)

One Piece games (without the chaos)

Classic RPG grind loops
